# Animation & UI Projects
My animation and UI project will be shared in this repository.

## 1 - Fireworks animation
This animation is written in javascript using p5.js.The width and height of the canvas can changed from global variables and the animation will still work.

**Don't forget that you must run this script in a server otherwise it won't work.(Won't be able to access the local font file.)
I recommend the python http server, you just need to open cmd / terminal and go to the directory of your code files.Then write this command to console;**

***python3***

```Terminal
python -m http.server 7777
```

***python2***

```Terminal
python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 7777
```

**Now you can open your browser and go to 'localhost:7777'.**
